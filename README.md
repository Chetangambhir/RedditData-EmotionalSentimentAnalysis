Project: Comprehensive Reddit Data Analysis

Data Extraction and Web Scraping

Utilized Python, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to extract data from the Reddit website, as seen in Test1.py. This involved configuring a web browser to navigate and scrape content from specific Reddit URLs, focusing on the /r/mentalhealth/ subreddit and related posts.
Advanced Data Retrieval

Test2.py extends the data extraction process by scraping detailed content from individual Reddit posts. This script combines requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to handle complex web scraping tasks, including dealing with dynamic content and pagination.
Database Integration

Integrated SQLite for data storage, as observed in Test3.py and Test4.py. The scripts connect to a SQLite database (reddit_data.db) to store and manage the scraped data, ensuring structured and accessible data management.
Sentiment Analysis

Employed TextBlob and VADER Sentiment Analysis in Test3.py and Test4.py to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted Reddit content. This analysis helps in understanding the emotions and sentiments expressed in the subreddit posts.
Data Visualization

Test4.py includes functionality for visualizing the sentiment analysis results using Matplotlib. This involves creating plots to display the sentiment scores of Reddit posts over time, offering a graphical representation of the community's emotional trends.
Comprehensive Insight Generation

The project offers a holistic view of the Reddit community's sentiments, especially focusing on the mental health subreddit. It highlights trends, user sentiments, and the overall emotional landscape of the discussions.
